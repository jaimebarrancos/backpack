Guide to creating an asset / a store (where you sell assets)

## Rules:
1. The network must accept your store canister to be part of the network.
2. Your store needs to have a backpack with your assets
3. The only way to know if the person calling your canister is the owner is to call the reboot_backpack_checkOwnership of the caller canister.
